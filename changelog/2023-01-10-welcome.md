We are happy to introduce Out of Character Radio's API documentation page to help developers better under how they can leverage the API we offer.

We created this documentation page soley to document the different functions of our API and provide examples of how to utilize them.

To get started, simply navigate [here](/docs/intro) to the docs tab where you'll find our existing API endpoints. As we add new endpoints, we'll update this documentation site.

If you notice any errors, or bugs, feel free to create a PR on GitHub or email [webmaster@oocradio.com](mailto:webmaster@oocradio.com).
